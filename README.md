# Portfolio
My professional portfolio

As an experienced technical and security specialist, I am well versed in a range of aspects from low level technical processes such as automation, development, research, etc. To higher level concepts such as goal delivery, stakeholder communication and framework implementation (e.g., ISO 27001).

I believe I have demonstrated great value in all my previous employments. These have taken many forms such as automating tasks with either standard operating procedures or computational scripts/programs to increase company process efficiency, in some cases up to 10-fold. I have developed monitoring and practical applications when there were no solutions available in the market. However, I believe the biggest value that I can and have always provided, is my burning desire to learn, but also my own personal techniques and skills I have constructed over my career to perform this process as efficiently as possible.

In regard to my current career goals, we must look at the current global and economic situation. There's a lot of movement globally in the cyber world both good and bad. With recent humanitarian disasters and state sponsored attacks, I feel I have invaluable experience to bring to the table for any company in hardening their environments for both internal, stakeholder and customer needs.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration whilst reviewing my experience.

My up most pleasure,

Wayne Banner
